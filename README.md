# BCDDLFrequencyAnalysis
Tool to analyse BCDDL data.\\
This tool can be used to analyse the measured BCDDL respone to a given input signal.
The coherence can be analysed to choose an appropriate number of subsets, the Frequency 
Response Function (FRF) can be visualised as bode plots and a second order low pass 
with delay can be fitted to the data.
